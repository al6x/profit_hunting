Option Normalisation using Historical Data

Premiums calculated for each period and vol quantile:

    C_{eu}(K|Q_{vol}) = E[e^-rT (R-K)+|Q_{vol}]
    P_{eu}(K|Q_{vol}) = E[e^-rT (K-R)+|Q_{vol}]

    where R = S_T/S_0, K = K/S_0

Each return has its own risk free rate, so separate discount applied to each point, instead of appluing single discount
to aggregated premium.

Run `python option_norm/run.py`.

### Estimating Mean E[R]

Estimating from historicaly realised

    E_hist[R] = exp(E[log R] + 0.5*Scale[log R]^2)
    E_pred[R]  = model(period, vol | P)
    P ~ min L2[weight (log E_pred[R] - log E_hist[R])]

Positive scale used, to avoid inflating mean by negative skew, although effect is minimal.

Loss is weighted, to make errors equal across vols and periods.

1 and 9 vol deciles boost, as they look to be well shaped. As a side effect, the model underestimates mean at
long >730d periods, it's desired, because the dataset has survivorship bias.

Vol decile 10 ignored, it's too noisy. As result model understimates mean for 10 vol decile, it's desired.

Longer periods calculated with overlapping step 30d, and less reliably, so lowering weight a bit.

    weight = 1/period^2/vol^0.5
    weight[vol_dc in (1, 9)] *= 1.5

Found params: [-0.0008, 0.0076, 0.0392, 3.3841, 0.0033, -0.0038], loss: 1.2624

### Estimating Scale[log R]

Estimating from historicaly realised

    Scale_pred[log R] = model(period, vol | P)
    P ~ min L2[weight(Scale_pred[log R] - Scale_hist[log R])]

Loss is weighted, to make errors equal across vols and periods. Longer periods calculated with overlapping step 30d,
and less reliably, so lowering weight a bit.

    weight = 1/Scale_hist[log R]/period^0.5

Found params: [-0.7738, 1.8570, 1.2634, -0.1577, 0.2550, 0.0000, 0.0000, -0.0382, -0.0474], loss: 1.3217

### Strike normalisation

    E_pred[R]         = predict_mmean(period, vol | P)
    Scale_pred[log R] = predict_scale(period, vol | P)
    E_pred[log R]     = log E[R]_pred - 0.5*Scale_pred[log R]^2
    m = (log(K) - E_pred[log R])/Scale_pred[log R]

Compared to true normalised strike

    m_true = (log(K) - E_hist[log R])/Scale_hist[log R]

Normalising strike using mean, scale is biased as doesn't account for the distribution shape (skew, tails). But
should be consistent across periods and volatilities, as distribution should be similar.

Thre's minor mistake `E[log R] = log E[R] - 0.5*Scale[log R]^2` should use positive part of scale, but error is
very small, ignoring.

      for american option).
    - p_itm - realised probability of put ITM

Daily prices for 250 stocks all starting from 1973 till 2025, stats aggregated with moving window with step 30d, so
larger periods have overlapping. Dividends ignored. Data has survivorship bias, no bankrupts.

Data adjusted by adding bankrupts. The **annual bankruptsy probability** conditional on company volatility with total
annual rate P(b|T=365) = 0.5% to drop to x0.1.
